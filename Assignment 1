## Clarity and accuracy

**Central insight**
The central insight of the article “Airbnb Snowballs in Vermont Ski Towns, Bringing Cash and Concerns” by Alicia Freese was immediately identifiable from the headline. On a scale of 1-5, with 5 being excellent, I would rate the identifiability of the article’s main point a 5. The piece, published by Seven Days, examines how short-term Airbnb listings in communities near mountains in Vermont affect the number of available residential and seasonal accommodations in these high cost of living places. 

**Data visualizations**
The article included two data visualizations. The first data visualization maps the Vermont towns with the most Airbnb listings. The visualization utilizes dots of different sizes to indicate differences in the number of listings at each of the five towns in Vermont with the most Airbnb listings. The dots are positioned on a map of Vermont and shown in relation to mountains in the state. This presentation was the most efficient way to navigate the visualization because it seamlessly incorporates the numerical data of the Airbnb listings with the geographic information of the towns’ proximities to mountains in Vermont. 

To improve navigation through the data, I would suggest making the map interactive. Rather than just placing the numerical data about which Vermont towns have the most Airbnb listings at the bottom of the state map, I would suggest displaying that information when a reader hovers over a specific town on the map with their cursor. I think that this would provide a cleaner, less distracting presentation. 

The second data visualization allows readers to explore more specific information about the number of Airbnb listings in each of the five cities with the most listings in Vermont. This visualization combines several different features that provide a more holistic look into the number and variety of Airbnb listings in a specific town. Using a Select Town drop-down menu, readers can gain more information about the listings, their hosts, and how Airbnb has grown in the town over time. I think that this was not the most efficient way to navigate the visualization because it places too much varied information into too small of a space on the webpage, rendering the overall takeaway of the information a bit unclear. 

I would suggest creating a second drop-down menu to allow readers to filter the data further depending on what they’re looking for. For example, the data could be grouped by whether it pertains to listings or listing hosts.

**Data accuracy**
Using my own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, I think that the data is at least partially accurate. On a scale of 1-5, with 5 being most accurate, I would rate the accuracy of this dataset as a 3. 

The publication clearly states the sources of their data at the bottom of the article. The sources for the data are Vermont Airbnb listings, the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, and AirDNA. 

In her analysis of data on the number of rental spaces reported by Airbnb to the state of Vermont in the fifth graf, Freese implies that some Airbnb rentals may not have been reported to the state by Airbnb through the italicization of the word “reported.”

This implication that there may be more Airbnb properties in the state of Vermont than are recorded in the data makes me question the accuracy of the data. One source that I would suggest Freese check with is Airbnb itself to see if she can gain access to/FOIA for their records on how many rental listings the company has in the state of Vermont.       

One of the sources Freese interviewed, bed-and-breakfast owner Peter MacLaren, suggested that Airbnb listings negatively impacted the availability of housing for long-term and seasonal residents and increased local real estate costs. The article mentions that these concerns were shared by Airbnb owners, but does not provide data on whether the number of Airbnb listings actually had a negative impact on the availability of housing for long-term and seasonal residents. Freese does mention the percentage of the towns’ housing stocks that are comprised of Airbnb’s, but does not provide data that demonstrates these percentages take housing away from interested homebuyers.

And although the reporter consulted with Zillow to find the median housing price in Stowe to demonstrate the high cost of living in the town, I would recommend that Freese also consult the Housing Affordability Index as a point of comparison. The index measures the percentage of Americans that could make monthly payments on a median-priced house. This data would provide a point of comparison for the data from Stowe and allow Freese to contextualize the local housing affordability data.   

## Quality
This story was executed at a high degree of quality. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being excellent, I would rate this story a 4. 

One thing that Freese does well is drawing data from several sources to create a holistic picture of the way in which Airbnb listings are affecting housing in mountainside towns in Vermont. Pulling data from sources like Airbnb’s website, the U.S. Census Bureau, and Zillow, Freese seamlessly integrates data from multiple places to show the concentration of Airbnb listings in these five towns.

Another thing that Freese does well is showing the different aspects of life in this town that a high number of Airbnb listings can affect. Freese not only shows that the number of Airbnbs can drive up housing costs and thus deter homebuyers, but can also harm local bed-and-breakfasts by taking away business needed to stay afloat. 

One area for improvement would be to interview people who were interested in living in these towns as long-term or seasonal residents who were deterred from doing so because of the price or lack of available housing. One of the story’s main claims is that the number of Airbnb listings is preventing people from living in these five Vermont towns as long-term or seasonal residents. However, we never hear any of these voices in the story; getting quotes from someone who actually experienced this would bolster the claim’s credibility. 

Another area for improvement would be to include data about whether the residents of these towns want regulations to create new rules for Airbnb renters. The article mentions that towns in other states that have decided to make their own rules and that there’s no consensus in at least one town on how best to regulate the short-term rental industry. I would suggest looking for additional data or conducting a survey themselves about residents’ sentiments about regulating short-term rental properties like Airbnb listings. 

## Type and color
Based on my knowledge of color and type use, I think Freese used type and color to their best purpose. Each visualization made sense and clearly conveyed the data being presented. Type and color remained consistent throughout the piece, giving the impression that all of the information belonged together. 

In the first visualization at the start of the article, the map features a blue color scheme and a white, sans-serif font that is used throughout the graphic. This presentation makes sense for several reasons. One is the visualization of the towns in relation to the mountains, thus demonstrating the appeal of these locations to tourists looking for short-term rentals. Another is the use of the color blue to visualize these chilly mountainside places. 

I would rate the type used in this visualization as a 4 out of 5 because the sans-serif font is easy to read, even against the colored background. I would rate the use of color as a 5 out of 5 because it correlates to the cool temperatures in the environment being discussed. 

In the second visualization at the end of the article, the interactive presents data on Airbnbs in each respective town. The data for each town features a different color scheme that differentiates it from the others. This presentation makes sense because in keeping the colors cohesive for each town but different from all the other towns, the data for each town looks as if it belongs together but remains visually identifiable from the other towns.  

I would rate the type used in this visualization as a 5 out of 5 because it makes use of color to highlight important information at the top of each town’s information. I would rate the color used in this visualization as a 5 out of 5 because it uses different colors as a kind of organizational method that does not feel busy and does not detract from the data being presented. 

## Creativity
The piece used creative elements to good effect by adding detail without visually distracting the reader. One creative element was the inclusion of mountains in the first visualization because it showed why there might be tourists to the area and a corresponding high demand for short-term rental properties. In keeping the mountains white in this visualization, it added an additional layer of information without distracting from other aspects of the map or from the existing color scheme. 
Another creative element was the inclusion of a drop-down menu in the second visualization. This allowed readers to select which information they wanted to see rather than to be bombarded with all the data for each town at once.  

# Story pitch
* What interesting question I want to answer
  * Does the media coverage of missing women of color change when a missing white woman gains national media attention?
  * How does media coverage for missing white women differ from that for women of color? 
  * How does the language in media coverage for missing women differ between women of color and white women? 
* What data may be available (or how you could collect your own dataset) to help me answer it
  * data on the number of missing women of color from the National Missing Persons database
  * data on the representation of different groups of color in coverage of missing persons in comparison with the number of that race reported missing in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's data on active cases
  * data on the use of details not pertinent to the story to describe the missing person, such as racializing language. I would be interested in gathering this data myself by gathering information from several print media sources on the language used in coverage of Gabby Petito's missing persons case versus that used in the coverage of women of colors' disappearances.
* Why this story is timely now
  * This story is timely now because of the recent disappearance of Gabby Petito gaining national media attention. The 22-year-old white woman received intense media coverage from outlets around the country, raising questions about the lack of media coverage for the hundreds of missing women of color. Amid our nation's continued racial reckoning in the wake of George Floyd's murder last year, Petito's case has sparked a reconsideration of "Missing White Woman Syndrome" and how media outlets can more equitably cover missing women of color. 
* What types of people you could talk to for sources
  * Advocates for missing women of color
  * Experts who study criminal justice and the media
  * Experts who study race and the media
* Anything else important to know 
  *One data point that I'd be interested in keeping track of over the next couple of months is how the media coverage of missing women of color changes as Gabby Petito's case leaves the media spotlight. Will the coverage of missing women of color decline as the buzz around Petito's case does, or will news media outlets maintain coverage of these types of missing persons cases?
