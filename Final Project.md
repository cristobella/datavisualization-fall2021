WASHINGTON — Republican Glenn Youngkin drew more than 1.6 million votes in his run for governor this November, defeating previous Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe and signaling a shift right for Virginia.

In a state Biden won by [10 percentage points](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/virginia-2020/) last year, 12 Virginia counties flipped for Youngkin and nearly every county saw a shift to the right, allowing him to win by [almost two percentage points](https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2021%20November%20General/Site/Statewide.html). This year’s election also saw significantly higher Republican turnout than previous gubernatorial races in Virginia, increasing the number of votes for the Republican candidate by half a million since 2017 and by over 650,000 since 2013. 

Isabel Holloway, an Emerson College polling analyst, said there was generally more “Republican excitement and enthusiasm to vote in (this year’s) election.”

“The Democrats thought that because McAuliffe was such a known name in the state that would give him an inherent advantage,” Holloway said. “That doesn't appear to be true, especially with the rising negative sentiment towards the Democrats who are currently in charge of the White House, the Senate and the House. It just wasn't enough.”

Trends historically show the party that wins the White House loses the Virginia governor’s race the following year. Election outcomes follow this pattern in [10 of the last 11 Virginia elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/politics/democrats-virginia-governor-race.html). The only exception? McAuliffe’s 2013 win following Obama’s re-election.

So the Republican resurgence wasn’t entirely unexpected, but the number of voters casting their ballot for Youngkin was unprecedented.

## Voter Turnout Increased Overall, but More So For Republicans

Voter turnout for Virginia gubernatorial elections has grown significantly over the past eight years. While only [2.2](https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/43843/) million people voted in the 2013 election, nearly [3.3](https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2021%20November%20General/Site/Statewide.html) million showed up to the polls in 2021. 

Previously, there seemed to be consensus among Democrats that increasing access to voting would benefit their party. Former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam even helped make it easier to vote through a series of recent legislation, [including removing a previous voter ID requirement](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&typ=bil&val=hb19), [allowing absentee voting with no excuse required](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&typ=bil&val=hb1&ses=201&typ=bil&val=hb1), [designating Election Day as a state holiday](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB601) and [instituting automatic voter registration](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB219) for those who receive or renew their license in the state.

However, this year’s increased voter turnout was most beneficial for the Republican candidate, as Youngkin earned nearly 500,000 more votes than 2017 Republican candidate Edward Gillespie, and over 650,000 votes more than 2013 Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli.

McAuliffe still earned almost 200,000 votes more than Gov. Northam in 2017, and nearly 600,000 more than he did in 2013, but the increase wasn’t enough to earn him a victory.

Holloway said increased Republican turnout was likely a result of heightened tensions, especially among parents, who were hit hard by the pandemic and watched their children struggle with remote learning. 

“Republicans are doing a better job at harnessing those voters and convincing them that their policies regarding the pandemic and regarding learning and how schools should be functioning in this day and age are more persuasive,” she said. 

Youngkin latched onto a [comment](https://www.mystateline.com/news/politics/mcauliffe-i-dont-think-parents-should-be-telling-schools-what-they-should-teach/) McAuliffe made during a debate on September 28, in which he said, "I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach." The Youngkin campaign used this to energize parents around the idea they should have a say in school curriculums and heightened tensions further by promising to ban critical race theory in Virginia schools.

“The Republicans have often used culture war sorts of issues to help keep their voters together,” said Lauren Bell, a political science professor at Randolph-Macon College.

Although it became a major issue in the campaign, critical race theory is not a part of the curriculum for Virginia’s K-12 schools, and is, instead, an [academic concept](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05) often taught in colleges which promotes the idea that racism is inherently linked to legal systems and government policies. 

According to [exit polls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2021/exit-polls-virginia-governor/#h-Y5IF6NZDJZFT3PK2ZNXGJRNMMQ), 24% of voters said education was their top issue in deciding who to vote for. Another one-third said the economy/jobs mattered most to them, and 15% were primarily concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic. 

## Counties That Carried Biden Flipped For Youngkin

Though Virginia went blue for President Biden in 2020, a dozen counties flipped red this November, helping Youngkin take the governorship.

For certain counties, this flip was expected, said Lakshya Jain, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley and contributor at Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter run by the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.

Looking at Virginia Beach County, Jain said, “Youngkin was from there, so it makes sense that the swing we saw was amplified.” 

What stood out, he added, was the overall shift in Republican support from 2020 to 2021. 

“It was almost just like a thermostatic swing right,” Jain said. 

Voter turnout differs greatly between presidential races and gubernatorial races, but the shift right speaks to former President Donald Trump’s impact on previous presidential elections. 

“I buy that there were quite a bit of just like, anti-Trump, Biden voters only [in 2020]. Typically, what we tend to see is that presidential partisanship shifts first and then down ballot shifts later,” Jain said, suggesting there were many Republicans who voted for Biden and then for Youngkin the following year. 

Holloway said the same, adding that Youngkin’s messaging on the importance of parental input in schools “resonated with those swing voters who may be traditionally Republican voters but had gone over and voted Democrat in 2016 and 2020.”

McAuliffe tried to appeal to anti-Trump voters, focusing much of his advertising on associating Youngkin with Trump. According to data from [AdImpact](https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/governors/virginia-governor/what-will-we-learn-virginia-governors-race), 13 out of 36 ads run from McAuliffe’s campaign since June linked his Republican opponent to Trump. 

“When I was governor last time, I worked with reasonable Republicans to get things done,” said McAuliffe in his [first TV ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=08YMR7NgANI) for the general election following his nomination from the Democratic party. “But let me be clear, Glenn Youngkin is not a reasonable Republican. He is a loyalist to Donald Trump.”

“Every ad that I saw on TV, it was always saying things about Youngkin and about how he supports Trump,” said Michelle Merritt, a 38-year-old realtor who voted for Youngkin in Stafford County. “Who cares if that's true? Tell me what you support. Tell me what you’re going to do. I don’t want to vote on you based on what the other candidate did or didn’t do.”

According to Bell, efforts to tie Youngkin to Trump “really turned off a lot of voters, [including] perhaps some independents who might have otherwise been inclined to vote for McAuliffe.”

While exit polls [show](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2021/exit-polls-virginia-governor/#h-Y5IF6NZDJZFT3PK2ZNXGJRNMMQ) that only 38% of those who identify as independents/others voted for Trump in 2020, 54% of that same group voted for Youngkin this year. 

Youngkin was careful to keep Trump at a distance during his campaign, differing in the strategy outlined by his Democratic opponent. 

“I think Youngkin was very effective at keeping a distance from Trump and really focusing the campaign on what he perceives, and the Republican Party perceives, as Democratic mismanagement, whether that be just in the state of Virginia or on the national level,” Holloway said. 

Jain said he thinks the rightward swing in the state reflects Biden’s diminishing approval ratings. According to [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/329384/presidential-approval-ratings-joe-biden.aspx), his approval rating remained at his all-time low of 42% leading up to the election.

“This has to do with Biden’s approvals more than anything,” Jain said. “You don’t vote for the party you’re not happy with.” 

Between Biden’s disapproval, a fractured national Democratic party and a lack of enthusiasm in McAuliffe’s candidacy, Youngkin was able to capitalize on the energy and excitement that typically comes after one party loses power, motivating Republican and independent voters to cast their ballots.
