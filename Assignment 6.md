# Assignment 6: Data Visualization Part II

I created this grouped column chart using Datawrapper. 

[Cocoa Bean Imports](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Giz4v/3/)

## Process

1. I began by transposing the dataset we were provided in [Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Sc1iH5M7sq_KvN_q-ajhdNANsBJ5TsI/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109300228864836185791&rtpof=true&sd=true) so that the information would visualize properly in Datawrapper.
2. I imported the Excel sheet into Datawrapper, where I double-checked the information for accuracy with the original download provided for Assignment 5.
3. I experimented with different chart types to find the one that I think works best for this particular project. I chose a grouped column chart because I know that this chart type is optimal for showing magnitude (such as with commodity production) and change over time (such as to emphasize changing yearly trends). I wanted to display the magnitude of cocoa beans imported in a given region and how the amount of cocoa beans imported to a region changed each year from 2015 to 2019.
4. I customized the chart to reflect the content of the data, choosing a color palette to match the subject matter. 
5. I added a title, description, credit line, and source line to ensure that the chart met the parameters of the assignment. 
6. I published and exported the visualization.
